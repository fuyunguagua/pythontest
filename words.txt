I have a good friend, her name is Li Hua. We met each other when I came to middle school. 
We are not in the same class, but we join the basketball club, as we have the same interest, 
we become good friends soon. Li Hua knows me well, I like to talk to her, 
because she is a good listener. When I complain, she will listen to what 
I say and then console me. Every time when I talk to her, 
I feel much better and forget about my annoyance.
 A good listen works so much, Li Hua is like the angel and brings me the sunshine.
